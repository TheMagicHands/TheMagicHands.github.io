        <h3>Hey There!</h3>
        <p>
             I design to reduce the amount of times we say <em>this shouldn't be this difficult </em>and <em>it was a good idea but poorly executed</em>. Moreover,
            as a designer I seek to <strong>challenge the current state of design</strong> and prove that supposed unfeasible concepts can be done, and done well. While many 
            of my projects reside in the digital realm, I am constanly curious about apllying these concepts to the world around us.
